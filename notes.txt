
capping and loading - for outlier analysis - instead of removing the outliers or imputing them, repace the values with cap (highest value)

mean/median or mode for imputing (how to select depending on the data - remove a single value out of a variable and impute using mean/ median
/mode/knn and then check which gives closer match)

check correlation for categorical variables using chi-square test
